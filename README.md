The main purpose of this project is to identify how diabetic drugs are affecting a particular person. In this project we have used data mining techniques like naïve bayes classification to identify the effect of diabetic drugs on individuals.so that it becomes easy to prescribe the drugs.Usually many project we will try to determine the prediction of diseases but usually they don't try to predict the medicines,this is as equally important since it will tell you how it is going affect the disease or human body
Now a days, a most common disease is Diabetes. Doctors who are having less experience, they don’t know correctly what medicines to be prescribed, how it’s going to affect the body and to what extent its going to be cured, we can take the old records of the admitted patients then, we apply some data mining algorithms like Naïve Bayes Classifier and Decision Tree induction to know how it’s affecting and its now easy to prescribe medicines based on results.
In this project data collected from the hospitals is used to apply the predictive data mining techniques. Data pre processing techniques like removing outliers, data cleaning, data normalization and data reduction are done. we apply niave bayes classification algorithm on the data ,that is obatained  after pre processing. With the application of naïve bayes algorithm we can know wether a drug can be prescribed to that individual or not.
